# Semantic Data Management
## Knowledge Graph Lab 3

The following project contains two files:
- [generateData.py](generateData.py) : Generates the data for some relations needed to create the graph
- [abox.py](abox.py) : Uses the library `rdflib` to create the graph, reading the files from `data`

Then the graph is uploaded to a GraphDB leaving this structure:

### Class hierarchy:

![class_h.png](images%2Fclass_h.png)

### Class relations:

![class_r.png](images%2Fclass_r.png)
